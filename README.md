COCOA is an Android app that keeps users updated with the **CO**VID **CO**ntainment zones in their vicinities. [According to the Health Ministry of India,](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/pdf/Containmentplan16052020.pdf)
>A Covid Containment Zone refers to a specific geographical area where positive cases of coronavirus are found. Strict movement restrictions are put in place in such areas to prevent further spread of the virus.

5. Chandigarh
6. Bangaluru
7. Chennai

More regions are being added daily to the database which shall automatically reflect in the app without any changes to its build.

## Inspiration
COCOA was developed as a beginner project for 30 Days of Kotlin event of Google Devs India. It has been made completely by me during the month of May, 2020. I developed this Application in order to learn Android Development using Kotlin along with the wish to contribute to a real-time use case. This app will be useful to increase awareness and inform status of Containment Zones to the people. Also, as the country comes out of lockdown, people will know which areas to avoid while travelling.
